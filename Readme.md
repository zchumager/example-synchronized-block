# Description

This is a basic Proof Of Concept (POC) created to demonstrate how to use Synchronize block
Synchronize block uses a monitor object which is the reference to make a thread pool to wait
for a notification

The idea is to set an object which can make the thread pool to wait for a notification 

* * In this example the thread pool wait when the product list is empty and the notification is send once a product is being added into the product list
